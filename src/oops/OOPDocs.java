	 *      -> use to represent real world things/entity.
	 *      -> class contains properties and methods.
	 *      -> its a collection/group of objects having similar behaviors.
	 *      -> also called template/blue print of object.

	 *   # Object/Instance :
	 *   -------------------
	 *   -> implementation of class.
	 *   -> instance of class  
	 *   -> object contains instance variables and instance methods.
	 *   -> object allocates memory when it created.

	 *   syntax :

	 *   # process of accessing properties and methods of parent/super/base class
	 *     to child/sub/derived class is  known as inheritance.
	 *     
	 *   # also called IS-A relationship
	 *   # Its a Generalization to specialization process.
	 *   # we can inherit static properties and methods also.
	 *   # we can't inherit private properties,methods and constructors.
	 *   # we can't inherit final class.
	 *   # we can inherit only one class at a time.
	 *   # 'extends' keyword is used for inheritance.
	 *   
	 *    syntax :
	 *    
	 *      class  child_class_name   extends  parent_class{
	 *      
	 *           //properties  : parent + child
	 *           
	 *           //methods     : parent  + child
